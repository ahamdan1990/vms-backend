🔄 COMPLETE VISITOR INVITATION WORKFLOWS
Workflow 1: Digital Self-Invitation (Staff)

Staff logs in → Creates/selects Visitor Profile
Staff creates Invitation (self as host)
System checks:

Building capacity limits (max per time slot)
Time conflicts for same visitor (warn admin/staff only)


Invitation → Pending Admin Approval (ALWAYS required)
Admin reviews and approves/rejects (with VIP override capability)

Workflow 2: Digital Admin-Created (Admin for Staff)

Admin creates/selects Visitor Profile
Admin creates Invitation and assigns Staff as host
System checks capacity + conflicts (warnings only)
Admin approves immediately or queues for review

Workflow 3: PDF Template Workflow

Staff downloads PDF Template from system OR Admin emails template
Staff fills PDF form manually (offline)
Admin uploads completed PDF to system
System auto-parses PDF → Creates Visitor Profile + Invitation
System checks capacity + conflicts
Admin reviews auto-created invitation → approves/rejects

Workflow 4: Walk-in Visitor (Receptionist)

Unknown person approaches receptionist
Receptionist creates Visitor Profile on-the-spot
Receptionist creates Invitation (expedited approval)
System notifies admin for quick approval
Admin approves/rejects
If approved → Check-in process + badge printing


🤖 FACIAL RECOGNITION INTEGRATION WORKFLOWS
FR Event Processing Pipeline:
FR Camera → Face Detected → System Identifies Visitor → Real-time Notifications
Scenario 1: Pre-Approved Visitor Arrival (FR Detected)

FR System detects face at entrance camera
Background Service identifies visitor from database
System sends real-time notifications:

Receptionist: "John Doe has arrived - Meeting with Sarah at 2PM"
Host (Sarah): "Your visitor John Doe has arrived"
Admin: General arrival notification



Scenario 2: VIP Visitor Arrival (Priority Alert)

FR System detects VIP visitor
System sends PRIORITY NOTIFICATION:

Operator: 🔴 "VIP VISITOR: CEO John Smith detected at entrance"
Admin: 🔴 "VIP arrival alert"
Host: "Your VIP visitor has arrived"



Scenario 3: Unknown Face (Security Alert)

FR System detects unknown face
System alerts Receptionist: "Unknown person at entrance - Camera 1"
Receptionist initiates walk-in process

Scenario 4: Blacklisted Person (Security Incident)

FR System detects blacklisted individual
System sends SECURITY ALERT:

Admin/Security: 🚨 "SECURITY ALERT: Blacklisted person detected"
Receptionist: Immediate action required
